## Introduction

<b> DAFP-APP </b> is an application conceived to plan air taxi routing.  It is composed by a minimalist GUI, that enables to load, store and visualize data, call an optimization module and visualize the routes created by the algorithm. It was part of a proof of concept that should be presented to an African company to get a research funds through a partnership between the company and the university. 

The software is totally developed in C# and WinForms. The data is loaded using .xlsx files and stored in a SQL Server database. Most of the code was written in 2018 and 2019 in a fast pace. I restarted the development in the end of 2024 as an excersize to improve my C# skills and for trainning code review and refactoring.
